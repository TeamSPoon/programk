This is an interpreter for 'notaiml', a language that is semantically identical to AIML but has a friendlier syntax.


This is in early stage and not useful to others I think.

designnotes.txt is some design notes.
notaimlspec.txt is a formal description of the language.

to run

xpce -s webserver.pl

server(5000).

then browse http://localhost:5000/aiml
